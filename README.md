Hi, my name is Touger Thao and welcome to my portfolio.

I highlight 3 projects to demonstrate my software development capabilities (mostly front-end but some backend with Rust and CosmWasm as well).

I built this site using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
